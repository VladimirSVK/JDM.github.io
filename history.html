			<h2>History of JDM</h2>
			<p>JDM, or Japanese Domestic Market, refers to the Japanese market for vehicles and parts that are designed and manufactured in Japan. The JDM culture has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s, when Japanese automakers began exporting their cars to other countries, including the United States.</p>
			<p>During the 1980s and 1990s, JDM cars became increasingly popular among car enthusiasts in the United States and other countries. The popularity of JDM cars was due in part to their unique styling, high performance, and advanced technology.</p>
			<p>Today, JDM culture continues to thrive around the world, with car enthusiasts modifying and racing JDM cars, attending JDM car shows and events, and collecting JDM parts and memorabilia.</p>
